# 01 - Drum Kit.
Key Event Listener, audio play and toggle class.

## Bind an event to our keys when they are pressed.

`window.addEventListener('keydown', playSound)`

- `playSound()` is a listener for `keydown` events registered using `window.addEventListener`.
- `window` is the global object in a browser, or the root object of the DOM. And  `document` stands for DOM.

### `data-key` has its own value on `<div>`s and `<audio>`s in HTML

```
const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);
const key = document.querySelector(`div[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);
```

- `keyCode` property is the *KEY* to connect our buttons(`<div>`s) and sounds(`<audio>`s).
- `keyCode` 's value is same as `ASCII` code (in lowercase letter ), check keycodes [here](http://keycode.info/).
- NOTE: `keyCode` is DEPRECATED. I'll update this in the future.
- `data-key` is set for mapping buttons and audios to get the `keyCode`s via `keydown` event.
- the whole `querySelector` expression has to be in back ticks (```).
- `${}` is syntactic sugar for template literals, read more about `Expression interpolation` [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)

### About playing sounds

How do we prevent delay playing sound, if we keep hitting a key?

just add `audio.currentTime = 0;` before `audio.play();`

### Toggling styles

- use `item.classList.add('className')` to add class when key pressed. (same as `element.addClass('className')` in jQuery)

- use `transitionend` event to remove `play` class. since we want to just remove `transform` property, so add a condition to skip others.

```
if(e.propertyName != 'transform') return;
this.classList.remove('playing'); // `event.target.classList.remove('playing');`
```

### forEach and Arrow function

- `items.forEach()` instead of just `forEach`, which means it's a property of an array.

- Arrow functions is ES6 syntax,

```
keys.forEach(key => key.addEventListener());
```

# 02 - Javascript + CSS Clock.
pointers rotate animation, get times, changing pointer positions.

### Initialize pointer positions and rotation along the x-axis

`transform-origin: 100%; // transform-origin: right;`

`transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier();`

- `transform-origin` moves the origin of rotation along x-axis. check it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin).

- `transition-timing-function` here is for the real clock **tic-tock**-like effect.

### Get time

`setInterval(setDate, 1000);`

- the `setInterval` function runs a function passed to it every interval specified which to implement the second pointer's rotating effect.

- create `Date()` to get `now.getSeconds()`, `now.getMinutes()` and `now.getHours()`.

- culculating angles of pointers

`const secondDegrees = ((seconds / 60) * 360) + 90;`

(the initial state of pointers are 90 degrees)

### Wait...is that a glitch!?

Due to there is a glitch that occurs at every 0th second and our transition is set at 0.05s. When hand transition from final state to initial state, because the number of degrees reduce, the hand makes a (reverse) anti-clockwise motion to reach the 0 degree mark, so we'll see it occurs.

To bypass it, we remove the `transition` property at the specified degrees (where glitch occurs) via JavaScript.

```
if (secondsDegrees === 90) secondHand.style.transition = 'all 0s';
else secondHand.style.transition = 'all 0.05s';

if (minsDegrees === 90) minHand.style.transition = 'all 0s';
else minHand.style.transition = 'all 0.1s';
```
